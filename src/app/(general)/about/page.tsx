            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>MuView is a project designed and created by myself, Brian Bollen. It is a project that was first designed in 2018 for a Data Visualization graduate course.</p>
            <p>The overarching goal of MuView is to provide information to music lovers everywhere in a meaningful and accessible way. In general, it is tedious and sometime downright impossible to find the cross correlation between music reviews from multiple sources. This makes it difficult to focus on music that you believe may be of interest to you.</p>
            <p>I don't want to die knowing there were albums I could have enjoyed more than the last.</p>
            <h1>Project Goals</h1>
            <p>Currently, MuView is in a static state where it new reviews (and backlogging old reviews) will be done periodically. Below are some additional goals for what MuView will eventually do.</p>
            <h2>Personalized Profiles</h2>
            <p>Once authentication is all set up, users will be able to log in to allow persistent data across reloads. With this will come several other features.</p>
